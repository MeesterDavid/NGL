# Neural Graphics Library

## Description
This project aims at gaining more insight into Machine Learning techniques like multi-layer perceptrons. The idea is that we somehow render and run it directly on the GPU.

## Disclaimer
I'm a newbie at both OpenGL and Rust so this might take a while or maybe I will fail completely. We will see..
