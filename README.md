# Neural Graphics Library

## Description
This project aims at gaining more insight into Machine Learning techniques like multi-layer perceptrons. The idea is that we somehow render and run it directly on the GPU.

## Install notes
To make sdl2 work check out: https://crates.io/crates/sdl2 \

## Disclaimer
I'm a newbie at both OpenGL and Rust so this might take a while or maybe I will fail completely. We will see.. \
I know it doesn't make that much sense to use OpenGL in Rust and to learn OpenGL and Rust at the same time. I'm just curious about Rust and stubborn. Don't fret about it.
